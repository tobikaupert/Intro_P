# Model analysis project

Our project is titled Overlapping generations model with a Pay-as-you-go system and is about the overlapping generations model, like the one originally proposed by Diamond (1965), which is a macroeconomic model whose aim is to analyze the macroeconomic dynamics and economic growth. 

The key assumption made is the population turnover: people only live for 2 periods, they are young and they work at the first period of their lives, they are old and are considered 'retirees' in the second period of their lives and then they die. In that setting, the economy and growth have still infinite horizon but individuals do not. Each period a new generation is born and an old one dies. We assume that n is the growth of the population.

The key innovation from the baseline model in this project is analyzing how introducing a social security transfer tax will impact the dynamics of the overlapping model. Specifically how does the tax impact capital accumulation, savings, and interest rate dynamics.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject\FinalProject.ipynb].

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
