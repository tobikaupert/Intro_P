    "In this assignment we found optimal consumption and labor supply for various wage rates. It was found that as wage rate increased that both optimal labor supply and consumption increased linearly. Furthermore, as we analyzed the adjustments in the elasticity of labor supply from 0.3 to 0.1, we found an increase in total tax revenue that can be gathered. This was an observed increase in tax revenue from 1630 to 3196. lastly we optimized out tax paramaters to give our maximized tax revenue. "
